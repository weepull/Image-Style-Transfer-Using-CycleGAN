# Image Style Transfer Project

This project demonstrates image style transfer using deep learning techniques.

## Contents

- `ImageStyleTransfer_Final.ipynb`: Main notebook for style transfer.
- `NoTrainIST.ipynb`: Secondary notebook with alternative or supporting approach.
- `ImageStyleTransformationDataset/`: Custom dataset used for training and testing.
- `your_model_checkpoints/`: Pretrained model checkpoints.

## How to Use

1. Open `ImageStyleTransfer_Final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure the dataset and model checkpoints are in the specified folders.
3. Run the cells sequentially to perform image style transfer.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the code)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Matplotlib, PIL, etc.

## Credits

Created as part of a project on image style transformation using deep learning.
